# SVM-Classifier

In this project, I have classified images among 4 classes : <br> 1. Dog<br>
                                                             2. Cat<br>
                                                             3. Horse<br>
                                                             4. Human<br>
                                                             
<br>

### Dependencies :<br>
        1. NumPy<br>
        2. Pandas<br>
        3. OpenCV<br>
        4. Matplotlib

### Model :

Here, the SVM model uses PEGaSoS Algorithm to optimize the loss function. Also, One vs One Classifier model has been
used to classify the images.

### Accuracy :

The accuracy obtained is 86%, which is reasonable as compared to other Classifiers, due to Small Dataset and Low Quality Images.
